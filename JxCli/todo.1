+0. Missing __include__ file - failed to show error message
		+jay.go - is a CLI - should report to Stderr and have an option to tourn off colored output.
		*Missing file is by default a RED flaged item.
		*Option for ignoring missing files
		*__include_if_found__ -- should be a silent include if not found (sinclude)
			*sinclude
			*srequire
		*fmt.Printf ( "%sFailed to find file %s%s\n", MiscLib.ColorRed, afn, MiscLib.ColorReset ) // xyzzyReportError

		*2. Should have a flag that turn off colored reporing
		*3. Should have a "error check" test caase that verifies that an error occured.
	*4. Should be able to {{ __include__ "bad file name" }}			- test0010
